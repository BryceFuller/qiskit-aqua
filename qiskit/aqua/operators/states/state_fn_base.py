    1) A complex function over a single binary string (as compared to an operator, which is defined as a function
    over two binary strings).
    2) An Operator with one parameter of its evaluation function always fixed. For example, if we fix one parameter in
    the eval function of a Matrix-defined operator to be '000..0', the state function is defined by the vector which
    is the first column of the matrix (or rather, an index function over this vector). A circuit-based operator with
    one parameter fixed at '000...0' can be interpreted simply as the quantum state prepared by composing the
    circuit with the |000...0‚ü© state.

    NOTE: This state function is not restricted to wave functions, as there is no requirement of normalization.

    This object is essentially defined by the operators it holds.
